        Hew Underrock was last seen in a cave where a giant poisonous spider had set up its lair. It is said that Hew
        fought
        with the ferocity of a cornered rat but was finally overcome. His heroic stance on PPE vs. Armor will be
        celebrated as
        one of the greatest folleys of the Covid Age.
        <br><br>
        Maybe if he is resurrected he will wear both protective items as advised by his crew.
